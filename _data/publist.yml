- title: "Learning of Art Style Using AI and Its Evaluation Based on Psychological Experiments"
  image: hung_paper_1.jpg
  description: This paper try to investigate the the relationship between AI and art. To do so, firstly a topic of what art is and what beauty is will be discussed taking artworks of Naoko Tosa, one of the authors, as an example. Then a new methodology for approaching the relationship between AI and art will be proposed, and the results of verification through psychological experiments will be shown.
